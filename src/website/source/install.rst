Install
=======
To install, simple download the latest `zip file <https://github.com/jericks/geometrycommands/releases>`_ and place the **bin** directory in your path. You should then be able to run the **geom** command.

You can also download an uber jar that contains all of the required code and dependencies in one file that you can run with the **java -jar geom.X.X.jar** command.
